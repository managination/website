3. **Problem-Solution** - Highlight what problems are solved (bot fraud, compliance overhead)
4. **Aspirational Language** - "Possibilities", "Transform", "Enterprise-grade"
5. **Social Proof** - Reference to industry benchmarks without specific numbers
6. **Transparency Promise** - Mention "predictable, transparent pricing" to build trust

## Visual Impact

The pricing cards now look like:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Flexible Plans         │  │  Competitive Value      │
│  Built for Growth       │  │  Accessible Pricing     │
│  [Description...]       │  │  [Description...]       │
└─────────────────────────┘  └─────────────────────────┘
```

Instead of:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Subscription           │  │  Transactional          │
│  €10/month              │  │  Pay-as-you-go          │
│  [Description...]       │  │  [Description...]       │
└─────────────────────────┘  └─────────────────────────┘
```

## Rationale

**Why remove pricing from homepage:**
1. **Qualification** - Encourages prospects to contact sales for proper qualification
2. **Flexibility** - Allows for negotiation and custom packages
3. **Positioning** - Focuses conversation on value, not cost
4. **Competition** - Doesn't lock in pricing that competitors can see
5. **Market Testing** - Can test different pricing without updating website

**When to discuss pricing:**
- Sales calls after demonstrating value
- Demo meetings where ROI is clear
- Custom proposals based on specific needs
- Pricing page (separate from homepage) if needed

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want a dedicated pricing page later:
1. Create `pricing.md` with detailed plans
2. Add "Get Pricing" CTA buttons on homepage
3. Link to contact form or calendly
4. Keep homepage focused on value and features

The homepage now focuses on value proposition and benefits while maintaining a premium, enterprise-ready positioning.
